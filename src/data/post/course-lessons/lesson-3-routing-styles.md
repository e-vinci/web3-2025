## Introduction

We've done a good job last week to get all parts of a modern application working - front end, API and database - we even deployed it.

Now let's be honest, looking at our screen, this looks more like a technical proof of concept than something any real users may want to use - let alone may for:

![Basic App](../../../assets/images/basic-app.png)

Our goal this week is to transform this into something that's *usable*. That means a lot of work on the front end.

> From the trenches: 

## Setup

- Get [last week's solution](https://github.com/e-vinci/web3-2025/tree/main/exercises/lesson-2-deploy-and-persistence) as a starting point for this exercise. You can also work from your own code (assuming you got it working), but you may need to adapt a bit the instructions.
