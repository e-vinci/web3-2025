# Web 3 - Introduction

---

- Why is this in :uk: ???
- We're speaking French, but let's get used to documentation and specs in English

> "This way is the way of the World"

(you have tools enough to help if you need it)

---

## Course goals

- Code as in the real world
- Give you tools to face standard challenges
- Building on top of the Web 2 course from last years

:new: and improved in 2025

This your last web course before going in internship - let's make good use of it

## Teachers

Philippe & Martin.
We're both seasoned developers doing part time teaching.
We try to bring you our own experience from a world you're joining in a few months

## Fil rouge

Session after session, we're going to create and improve an application to help people split expenses

- similar to Tricount, or Splitwise
- the point is to explore usual problems and acceptable solutions, not have a bulletproof app.

---

## Evaluation

- Continuous: 25% of the total
  - 20%: producing a video report of evaluating a new technology (in groups of 4-5)
  - 5%: providing feedback to other groups through at least 5 reviews
- Exam: 75% of the total - reviewing a piece of code (on a school machine, limited internet, no AI)

Note the continuous evaluation is final (no way to represent it in August)

---

## Project

- Groups of 4-5
- Pick a tech topic (framework, language, whatever) **not covered in the curriculum**
- Deliver a 15 minutes video + a git repository with examples

---

## Reviews

- Individual
- Watch other group videos and provide at least 5 reviews for at least 2 different groups.
- The clarity, maturity, and helpfulness of your reviews will be evaluated.

---

## Exam

- What's a Pull Request?
- We want you to exercise **reading code** and giving **meaningful feedback**
- There will be no AI nor Internet at your disposal but any code you write will not be evaluated on being runnable.
- We're going to practice this every week together
