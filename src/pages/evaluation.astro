      <p class="my-4">
        Around the fifth week of the course, a group project will be initiated. This project is designed to encourage collaboration and deepen your understanding of web technologies. The project will be done in groups of 4-5 students, and each group will select a topic related to a framework, technology, or language not covered in the regular curriculum. The goal is to explore new areas and broaden your technical horizons.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
            For the end of the 5th week, groups must be formed and topics validated. Students can then start working on the topic alongside the course. They will need to produce a video of at least 15 minutes that presents the technology, its strengths, weaknesses, use cases... A git repository must be made available with examples of the technology's application.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
        The teachers will evaluate the videos. The rest of the group may be asked to provide feedback on a given number of videos. The project result and evaluation is final and cannot be presented again in august.
